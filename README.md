# Graphql Sandbox

This project is similar to GraphiQL and based on its foundational parts, but delivers a unique experence where it allows you to write JavaScript code to generate graphql variables or request headers at execution time using Web Workers. This allows you to streamline authentication workflows, add comments to your variables effortlessly, and utilise random uuids for exported templates.
